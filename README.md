# Morgan Stanley Machine Learning Research

This respository contains code for papers and projects published by
the Morgan Stanley Machine Learning Research team.

## Who We Are

The Machine Learning Research team at Morgan Stanley harnesses the
advances of machine learning techniques across the firm. The ML
Research team is comprised of hyper-specialist researchers who work on
fundamental and complex problems. The team has worked in a wide
variety of areas including time series analysis, recommender systems,
network theory, NLP for finance, fairness, privacy, and more. The
central ML Research team spearheads engagements with academia, both by
collaborating with university labs and by publishing in top-tier
conferences.
